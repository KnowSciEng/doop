P/Taint activated using the `--informatoin-flow` flag and is fully integrated into Doop, and available for both Souffle and Logicblox backends. P/Taint can track taint flow out of the box through Android applications, Servlet application. Custom platform architectures can be easily integrated into P/Taint by creating new lists of taint sources and sinks and taint transform methods.
